# News-Site

This is an example project of a small reddit-esque clone built using the [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) framework. There are minimal other modules and frameworks used in order to show an understanding of stylings and functionality from scratch. The website retrieves infomation from an external server via a custom API created in an earlier project. You can find the links at the bottom of this readme.
